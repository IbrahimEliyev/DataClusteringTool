# DataClusteringTool

A Python-based tool for clustering datasets using popular machine learning algorithms. Designed to help you analyze and group data into meaningful clusters, visualize results, and evaluate clustering performance.

## The tool implements the following clustering algorithms:

- **K-Means** – partitions data into K clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

- **DBSCAN** – detects dense regions in data and identifies outliers.

-**Agglomerative Clustering** – builds a hierarchy of clusters using a bottom-up approach.

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.6+** – Core programming language
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms, including clustering
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
